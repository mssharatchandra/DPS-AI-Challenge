# DPS-AI-Challenge
This is the challenge for DPS. I have built and deployed AI models in VERTEX AI.

## The challenge is to use the AUTO-MPG dataset and  Googleâ€™s managed ML platform Vertex AI to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict the fuel efficiency of the given input array : test_mpg = [1, 2, 3, 2, -2, -1, -2, -1, 0]

## The predicted fuel efficiency of the given test_mpg array [1, 2, 3, 2, -2, -1, -2, -1, 0] is 17.07827
